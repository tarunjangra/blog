      <h1>Leaving ubuntu because of frequent crashes on my hardware</h1>
      <p>I switched to ubuntu 8.10 64-bit desktop edition with high expectations. But it couldn’t make me so relaxed. No doubt, 
It is very good linux distribution, i have ever seen. But Because of frequent crashes of operating system and firefox. I decided to leave ubuntu.  </p>



<p>I installed Ubuntu 8.10 on my AMD 64-bit processor with 2GB RAM and GIGABYTE M61PME-S2 mother board. It might be some hardware compatibility problem. What ever is this, But i don’t want to switch to windows. So i decided to try some other linux distribution. I decided to go for openSUSE 11.1. I am posting this post from opensuse 11.1. I am working on firefox from 3 hours. Yet i didn’t experience any crash. That’s great!!  Every thing working smoothly except my graphic effects. I saw exciting graphic effect in screenshots available on openSUSE. To be very frank, I was forced because of all these effects to try openSUSE once. But because of NVIDIA drivers problem, i couldn’t get yet. </p>

<p>I would like to mention one more thing here. I still want to use ubuntu if crashes get resolved some way. Waiting for their next release with LTS support. Thanks to openSUSE and ubuntu team.</p>
